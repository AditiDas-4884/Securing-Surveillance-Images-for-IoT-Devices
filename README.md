# Securing Surveillance Images for IoT Devices

Implemented the concept of Image Steganography. Here the sender embeds the secret message into the original cover image. After embedding the secret message, the stego-image is sent to the receiver. The receiver then decrypts the secret message from the stego-image. The technology used for the project is OpenCV-Python.
